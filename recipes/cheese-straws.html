        <li>350g pack ready-rolled puff pastry</li>
        <li>four handfuls grated parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Heat oven to 220c/fan 200c/gas 7</li>
        <li>Unroll a puff pastry, scatter over a couple of handfuls of grated Parmesan, then fold in half</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out to the thickness of a Â£1 coin. Cut into 1cm strips, then twist the strips 3-4 times</li>
